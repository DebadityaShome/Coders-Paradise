    "\n",
    "The different variable declarations with var, let and const can be confusing for newcomers to React even though they are not React specific.

In JSX - the syntax extension used for React - you can use plain JavaScript which includes if else statements, ternary operators, switch case statements, and much more. In a conditional render, a React component decides based on one or several conditions which DOM elements it will return. For instance, based on some logic it can either return a list of items or a text that says \"Sorry, the list is empty\". When a component has a conditional rendering, the appearance of the rendered component differs based on the condition.

    "There are many ways to declare a function in JavaScript. The two most common ways are by using function declaration or by function operator. In the function declaration, the function keywords appear before the function name. Whereas if the function keyword appears anywhere else, that means we are declaring the function by the function operator method. Given below are the six different methods which are used in JavaScript to declare a function."

    "| Name               | Explanation | Syntax |\n",
    "|--------------------|-------------|--------|\n",
    "|Function Declaration|All functions declared using this method allow hoisting; means they can be used before declaration.|function function_name(Arg1, Arg2..){}|\n",
    "|Function Expression |It is most suitable to use when you want to assign your function as an object to a variable. Itâ€™s often used when you want to use your function as callback function.|Named: var var_name = function function_name(Arg1,Arg2..){};Anonymous:var var_name = function(Arg1, Arg2..){};|\n",
    "|Generator Function Declaration|It is used to declare a Generator Function, a function that uses yeild keyword to return a Generator-Iterator object on which next method can be called later.|function* name(Arg1, Arg2..) {}|\n",
    "|Generator Function Expression|This is much similar to the type we just discussed above. The only difference is that it allows omitting name from the function.|Named: function* function_name(Arg1,Arg2..){} Anonymous:function* (Arg1,Arg2..){}|\n",
    "|Arrow Function|The two reasons why this type of functions were introduced in ES6 are: writer shorter syntax for function expressions and get rid of this value. You can exclude function parentheses if it only takes one parameter. You can also erase the curly brackets if thereâ€™s only one statement inside function body.|var var_name = (Arg1, Arg2..) => {};|\n",
    "|Function Constructor|Here, the Function keyword is actually a constructor which creates a new function. The arguments passed to the constructor become arguments of the newly created function and the last parameter is a string which is converted into a function body. This may cause security and engine optimization problems which is why itâ€™s always never recommended to use|var var_name = new Function(Arg1, Arg2..,'FunctionBodyString');|"
